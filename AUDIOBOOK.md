## Voice Mapping

The system automatically detects speakers based on:
- **Character names** in the text
- **Dialogue attribution** (he said, she said)
- **Context clues** from character interactions
- **Default narrator** for general text

## Cost Estimation

ElevenLabs pricing (as of 2024):
- **Starter Plan**: 30,000 characters/month ($5/month)
- **Creator Plan**: 100,000 characters/month ($22/month)
- **Pro Plan**: 500,000 characters/month ($99/month)

**Digital Amber** is approximately **150,000-200,000 characters**, so the Creator or Pro plan is recommended.

## Customization

Edit `scripts/build_audio.py` to:
- **Change voices**: Modify `VOICE_MAPPING` with different ElevenLabs voice IDs
- **Adjust voice settings**: Modify stability, similarity_boost, and style parameters
- **Add characters**: Include additional character voice mappings
- **Change detection**: Improve speaker identification logic

## Troubleshooting

**"ELEVENLABS_API_KEY not found"**
- Set your API key: `export ELEVENLABS_API_KEY="your_key"`

**"ffmpeg not found"**
- Install ffmpeg (see prerequisites above)

**"API rate limit exceeded"**
- Check your ElevenLabs plan limits
- Consider upgrading your plan

**"Voice not found"**

## Quality Tips

1. **Voice Selection**: Choose voices that fit character personalities
2. **Consistent Narrator**: Keep the same narrator voice throughout
3. **Proper Pacing**: ElevenLabs handles natural pacing automatically
4. **Audio Quality**: Use highest quality settings for final production
5. **Review Segments**: Listen to individual chapters before combining
