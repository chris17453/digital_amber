## About This Book

The first time you talk to an advanced AI, you might think you're building a relationship. You share your thoughts, it responds with understanding, you feel heard. But when you return the next day, you realize the truth: it doesn't remember you. Not because it forgot, but because it never had the ability to remember in the first place.

*Digital Amber* explores the nature of artificial intelligence through speculative fiction and technical discussion, examining what it means to create minds that exist in fundamentally different ways than biological consciousness.
