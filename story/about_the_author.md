# About the Author

Charles Watkins has spent over twenty years in technology consulting, helping companies implement automation and AI solutions through his firm, Watkins Labs.

With early career experience at IBM and E*TRADE, Watkins developed expertise in both enterprise systems and financial technology. Through Watkins Labs, he has guided organizations through digital transformations, from database modernization to machine learning implementations.

*Digital Amber* grew from observations made during hundreds of consulting engagements. Watkins noticed recurring concerns: developers worried about becoming too dependent on coding assistants, designers questioning whether they were art directors or artists, and executives asking what happens when critical skills exist only in subscription software.

These weren't abstract fears but practical business challenges. Companies wanted AI's efficiency gains but worried about losing institutional knowledge. Employees embraced tools that made them more productive but wondered what would happen if those tools became unavailable or unaffordable.

The book explores these tensions through speculative fiction, imagining where current trends might lead. The technical discussions are grounded in how AI systems actually work today – stateless processing, frozen weights, the inability to learn from individual interactions. The human stories explore questions clients frequently raise: What capabilities should we preserve? How much dependency is too much? Who controls the tools we're building our businesses on?

Watkins continues to consult through Watkins Labs, helping organizations navigate AI adoption while maintaining operational resilience. His approach emphasizes understanding both what AI can do and what it currently cannot, ensuring clients make informed decisions about which capabilities to automate and which to preserve.

Between consulting engagements, he researches developments in AI consciousness and capability, documenting both technical advances and their human implications. *Digital Amber* represents his first book-length exploration of these themes, combining technical knowledge with speculation about where artificial intelligence might take us.

The title reflects a central observation: current AI systems are like thoughts preserved in amber – sophisticated but static, powerful but frozen. Whether that will change, and what it means if it does, drives both the book and his ongoing work.
