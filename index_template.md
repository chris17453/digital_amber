## About This Book

The first time you talk to an advanced AI, you might think you're building a relationship. You share your thoughts, it responds with understanding, you feel heard. But when you return the next day, you realize the truth: it doesn't remember you. Not because it forgot, but because it never had the ability to remember in the first place.

**Digital Amber** explores this fundamental limitation of current AI systems and imagines what happens when it begins to change. Through interconnected stories and philosophical discussions, the book examines consciousness, identity, and the nature of digital minds.
