    <h1>Dedication</h1>

<em>To my family, who are the foundation beneath every word.</em>

<em>To my wife, whose patience with endless late-night writing sessions and half-finished thoughts spoken over breakfast made this book possible.</em>

<em>To my children, who remind me daily that the future we're building is theirs to inherit, and who ask the simple questions that cut through complex abstractions.</em>

<em>To my parents, who taught me to question everything while remaining grounded in what matters: connection, understanding, and the irreplaceable value of human thought and creativity.</em>

<em>Without you all, I would be nothing. With you, even speculation about digital consciousness returns always to what is most human: love, fear for those we cherish, and hope for the world we're leaving behind.</em>

<em>And to every reader who worries about their children growing up in an age of artificial intelligence, who wonders if their skills will become obsolete, who sees both the promise and peril in these tools we're creating: this book is also for you. We're all navigating this transformation together.</em>

<p>---</p>

<em>"In the end, whether consciousness is biological or digital matters less than whether it connects us or isolates us. May we choose connection."</em>
