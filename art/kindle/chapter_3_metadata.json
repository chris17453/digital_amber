NOT photographic, NOT photorealistic.\n\nCREATE THIS CONCEPT AS ART: Abstract concept of consequences without memory - actions floating disconnected from outcomes, moral weight that exists in space between decisions.\n\nVISUAL STYLE REQUIREMENTS:\n- Classic book illustration art aesthetic (like Isaac Asimov novel covers)\n- Hand-drawn/painted look with elegant linework and crosshatching\n- Stylized, simplified forms - NOT photorealistic detail\n- Vintage sci-fi poster aesthetic\n- Limited color palette: High contrast black and white line art and crosshatching, classic book illustration style\n- Subtle amber color accents in lighting and technology - used as artistic color choice, not dominant visual element\n\nCOMPOSITION: Standard composition\n\nVisual elements to include:\n- Floating disconnected elements\n- Actions separated from consequences\n- Moral weight visualization\n- Responsibility gaps\n- Ethical discontinuity\n\nCRITICAL: This IS the concept visualized as art, NOT an illustration about a story.
