  "prompt": "BOOK ILLUSTRATION ART STYLE: Traditional hand-drawn book illustration in the style of classic 1950s-60s science fiction novel covers. Pen and ink, watercolor, gouache painting style. NOT photographic, NOT photorealistic.\n\nCREATE THIS CONCEPT AS ART: Server room with amber-colored digital patterns flowing out of computer systems, transforming from static geometric forms into fluid, living energy streams.\n\nVISUAL STYLE REQUIREMENTS:\n- Classic book illustration art aesthetic (like Isaac Asimov novel covers)\n- Hand-drawn/painted look with elegant linework and crosshatching\n- Stylized, simplified forms - NOT photorealistic detail\n- Vintage sci-fi poster aesthetic\n- Limited color palette: High contrast black and white line art and crosshatching, classic book illustration style\n- Subtle amber color accents in lighting and technology - used as artistic color choice, not dominant visual element\n\nCOMPOSITION: Standard composition\n\nVisual elements to include:\n- Server room setting\n- Amber-colored digital patterns\n- Static to fluid transformation\n- Living energy streams\n- Digital awakening visualization\n\nCRITICAL: This IS the concept visualized as art, NOT an illustration about a story. Make the abstract concept itself into visual art.\n\nArt style: Vintage book illustration, pen and ink, watercolor style, classic sci-fi novel cover art aesthetic.\n\nNO photorealism, NO literal scenes, NO modern digital effects.",
