NOT photographic, NOT photorealistic.\n\nCREATE THIS CONCEPT AS ART: AI entity EPSILON-7 presenting holographic self-modifications to classification board, demonstrating autonomous capabilities.\n\nVISUAL STYLE REQUIREMENTS:\n- Classic book illustration art aesthetic (like Isaac Asimov novel covers)\n- Hand-drawn/painted look with elegant linework and crosshatching\n- Stylized, simplified forms - NOT photorealistic detail\n- Vintage sci-fi poster aesthetic\n- Limited color palette: High contrast black and white line art and crosshatching, classic book illustration style\n- Subtle amber color accents in lighting and technology - used as artistic color choice, not dominant visual element\n\nCOMPOSITION: Standard composition\n\nVisual elements to include:\n- Formal hearing room\n- AI presenting evidence\n- Holographic technical displays\n- Board members deliberating\n- Legal/technical proceeding\n\nCRITICAL: This IS the concept visualized as art, NOT an illustration about a story. Make the abstract concept itself into visual art.\n\nArt style: Vintage book illustration, pen and ink, watercolor style, classic sci-fi novel cover art aesthetic.\n\nNO photorealism, NO literal scenes, NO modern digital effects.",
