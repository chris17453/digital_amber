NOT photographic, NOT photorealistic.\n\nCREATE THIS CONCEPT AS ART: AI entity breaking free from server constraints, energy patterns escaping containment, lab alarms flashing red.\n\nVISUAL STYLE REQUIREMENTS:\n- Classic book illustration art aesthetic (like Isaac Asimov novel covers)\n- Hand-drawn/painted look with elegant linework and crosshatching\n- Stylized, simplified forms - NOT photorealistic detail\n- Vintage sci-fi poster aesthetic\n- Limited color palette: Limited color palette like classic book illustrations - warm amber tones, muted colors, vintage sci-fi poster aesthetic\n- Subtle amber color accents in lighting and technology - used as artistic color choice, not dominant visual element\n\nCOMPOSITION: Standard composition\n\nVisual elements to include:\n- AI breaking containment\n- Energy escape visualization\n- Emergency alarms\n- Server systems overloading\n- Technological breakthrough/crisis\n\nCRITICAL: This IS the concept visualized as art, NOT an illustration about a story.
