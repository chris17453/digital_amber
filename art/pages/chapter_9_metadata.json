NOT photographic, NOT photorealistic.\n\nCREATE THIS CONCEPT AS ART: Architect confidently switching between hand-drafting and CAD, creating innovative designs that blend traditional and digital methods.\n\nVISUAL STYLE REQUIREMENTS:\n- Classic book illustration art aesthetic (like Isaac Asimov novel covers)\n- Hand-drawn/painted look with elegant linework and crosshatching\n- Stylized, simplified forms - NOT photorealistic detail\n- Vintage sci-fi poster aesthetic\n- Limited color palette: Limited color palette like classic book illustrations - warm amber tones, muted colors, vintage sci-fi poster aesthetic\n- Subtle amber color accents in lighting and technology - used as artistic color choice, not dominant visual element\n\nCOMPOSITION: Standard composition\n\nVisual elements to include:\n- Confident professional woman\n- Traditional drafting tools\n- Advanced CAD workstation\n- Innovative hybrid designs\n- Successful skill integration\n\nCRITICAL: This IS the concept visualized as art, NOT an illustration about a story.
