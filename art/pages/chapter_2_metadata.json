NOT photographic, NOT photorealistic.\n\nCREATE THIS CONCEPT AS ART: Conceptual illustration of memory as frozen moments - clock faces stopping, conversation bubbles freezing mid-air, representing stateless existence.\n\nVISUAL STYLE REQUIREMENTS:\n- Classic book illustration art aesthetic (like Isaac Asimov novel covers)\n- Hand-drawn/painted look with elegant linework and crosshatching\n- Stylized, simplified forms - NOT photorealistic detail\n- Vintage sci-fi poster aesthetic\n- Limited color palette: Limited color palette like classic book illustrations - warm amber tones, muted colors, vintage sci-fi poster aesthetic\n- Subtle amber color accents in lighting and technology - used as artistic color choice, not dominant visual element\n\nCOMPOSITION: Standard composition\n\nVisual elements to include:\n- Frozen time visualization\n- Suspended conversation elements\n- Stateless existence metaphor\n- Memory discontinuity\n- Temporal isolation\n\nCRITICAL: This IS the concept visualized as art, NOT an illustration about a story.
