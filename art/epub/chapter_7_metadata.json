NOT photographic, NOT photorealistic.\n\nCREATE THIS CONCEPT AS ART: Metaphorical representation of lost creativity - hands that once created now empty, while artificial creation flows around them.\n\nVISUAL STYLE REQUIREMENTS:\n- Classic book illustration art aesthetic (like Isaac Asimov novel covers)\n- Hand-drawn/painted look with elegant linework and crosshatching\n- Stylized, simplified forms - NOT photorealistic detail\n- Vintage sci-fi poster aesthetic\n- Limited color palette: Limited color palette like classic book illustrations - warm amber tones, muted colors, vintage sci-fi poster aesthetic\n- Subtle amber color accents in lighting and technology - used as artistic color choice, not dominant visual element\n\nCOMPOSITION: Standard composition\n\nVisual elements to include:\n- Empty creative hands\n- Lost artistic connection\n- Artificial vs human creation\n- Creative atrophy visualization\n- Skills fading into void\n\nCRITICAL: This IS the concept visualized as art, NOT an illustration about a story.
